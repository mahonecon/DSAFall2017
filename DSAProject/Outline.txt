For the Project our group plans on using two queue ADTs and one array based list ADT.  The two queue ADTs will be used for the runway that the planes enter the airport at and the runway that the planes take off from.  The reason why queues are being used for the runways is because they are the fastest ADT for FiFo operations.  The list will be used to track the terminals that are being used in the project, because we may need to acess planes in all of the terminals without changing their order or moving them around. We are going to make a class for the planes with the following fields <fields>, and use a boolean to use simulate the gate opening and closing, because that does not need to be anymore than that.
The work will be divided into two parts, big and small.  One person will be making the classes and methods for the individual parts of the project while the other assembles it into the final menu driven project.  The presentation and final write up will be made by both memebers completely collabrativly upon completion of the application.
The space complexity for the array based list, and the queue is (2+numItems)* 4. The time complexity for the list has an average case of complexity of (n-1)/2 and n/2 for remove and add respectivly. The time complexity for the enqueue, dequeue, and size within the queue ADT are all a BigO(1).
